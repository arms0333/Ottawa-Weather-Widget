#Weather Widget
**Cody Armstrong**
  
   This application was made for my first year Javascript class, where I learned about using API's by setting up a key to retrieve information of the weather.

###How to understand the code
 - starting with the files directory you will see an Image folder along with 3 more folders for HTML, CSS & Javascript
 - the Image folder will contain all the icons needed for visual effects beside each forecast row
 - HTML is just basic divs and headings to contain information
 - CSS is slightly more complex due to the ability to resize the widget but basically its just colours and simple sizing
 - Javascript is where the majority of the code is found and within a function is the website that provides the API key

###How to use the code
 - The code is pretty straight forward, by just going to the site it is shown right away
 - It only shows on 12 hours at a time
 - This is centered on downtown ottawa so might be slightly different outside ottawa
